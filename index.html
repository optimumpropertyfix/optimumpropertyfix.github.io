      <p>Project Description:</p>
      <p>
        The current dormitory maintenance requests system at the University of
        Nevada, Reno (UNR) provides a system that is flawed and susceptible to
        complications. Some issues the current system faces are paper trails,
        leading to lost reports, a lack of maintenance request progress tracking
        for the students, and does not incentivize students to submit issues
        that occur within the property. With this, Optimum Property Fix (OPF)
        aims to revamp UNR’s current system through a new and improved
        maintenance request system, accessible to dormitory students as well as
        facilities and service members. OPF’s functionality fully eliminates the
        paper-based system and replaces it with a web application that retains
        all maintenance records in one place. Major accomplishments that were
        recently made for OPF are functional pages of the student side,
        consisting of communication means, forms, and a sign-in page. The web
        application utilizes artificial intelligence and quality data through
        two different user-focused experiences.
